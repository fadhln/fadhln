### I'm a Front-end Engineer, with a bit of everything.

> I am a skilled Front-end Developer with expertise in React and Typescript, as well as Back-end Development using Go. In addition, I have experience in IoT projects, which has given me a broader perspective on how software can interact with physical devices. My strengths lie in designing and developing user-friendly interfaces and applications that deliver a seamless user experience.

```typescript
// Defining myself

  public name: string;
  public location: string;

  public skills: string[];

  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Muhammad Fadhlan';
